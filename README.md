### [Lars Grundhöfer](https://www.dlr.de/en/kn/about-us/departments/nautical-systems)

<img src="lars_grundhöfer_cupped.jpg" alt="Forti" align="left" width="140" style="vertical-align:middle;margin:0px 25px 0px 0px"/>Lars holds a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering and Information Technology from the TU Ilmenau, Germany. He is currently working as a researcher for the German Aerospace Center, Institute of Communications and Navigation. His research primarily focuses on the development and enhancement of terrestrial navigation systems, particularly the medium-frequency R-Mode system, which serves as a backup to Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS). His work addresses the accuracy and reliability of position, navigation, and timing information in maritime contexts, especially when GNSS is unavailable or unreliable. He also explores the integration of terrestrial navigation with other systems, like low-cost software-defined radios and hybrid GNSS-terrestrial localization methods, aiming to enhance overall maritime navigation safety and reliability.
