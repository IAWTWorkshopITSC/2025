## Aim of the workshop

The **4th Workshop on Intelligent and Automated Waterway Transportation**, which will take place on November 18th, 2025 at the [28th IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems](https://ieee-itsc.org/2025/) in Gold Coast, Australia, aims to foster technical and scientific exchange between academia, industry, and public authorities in the rapidly evolving fields of autonomous waterborne transportation and smart intermodal logistics. It serves as a platform to present and discuss recent advancements in intelligent and automated systems for inland, coastal and off-shore maritime transportation. Key topics include autonomous vessel development, advanced assistance systems, modeling and simulation, digital twins for waterways, navigation and control strategies, as well as automation of cargo handling. By bringing together experts from research institutions, industry leaders, consultants, and regulatory bodies, the workshop encourages interdisciplinary dialogue and collaboration. As an integral part of the broader Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) community, the workshop emphasizes the role of autonomous shipping in shaping the future of transportation. 
Presentations by [invited experts](#invited-experts) will provide exciting insights into recent research achievements and innovative projects. Additionally, researchers will have the opportunity to present their work and connect with peers during the poster session.
